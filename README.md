# This is a simple Trivia Game App by Eduardo Souza.

*This project was created with the create-react-app (CRA) helper and modified manually.*

Quick step-by-tep to run:
- install node.js >= v10
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

-----

I removed all the boilerplate here. If you've never used CRA before, the following commands can be used under ./client folder:

### `npm start`
to boot up the app in **dev mode**

### `npm test`
to execute unit tests coverage

### `npm run build`
to build this app in **prod mode**

-----

### hosted version?
You can check my **hosted PROD version** of this app running in a [serverless environment with express by clicking here](https://gqzr1j.deta.dev).
