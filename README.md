# This is a simple Trivia Game App by Eduardo Nascimento Souza.

## This project was created with the create-react-app helper and modified manually.

I removed all the boilerplate here, so if you've never used CRA helper before, here are the commands from RCA you might want to use:

-----

The following must be ran inside ./client folder:

### `npm start`
to boot up the app in **dev mode**

### `npm test`
to run my unit tests (I created a few)

### `npm run build`
in case you want to build this app in **prod mode**

-----

### hosted version?
Please check my **hosted PROD version** of this app running in a serverless environment with express here: [deta url here]
